Requirement 2 - Product Description and Features

This project will dive deeper into React (Option 2) as it is an interactive online game.
I hope to create an interactive suduko game right in the browser. This will be aimed at those new to Sudoku becuase it will tell you when you placed a number in a conflicting row, column, or section. This will be shown in red. If you place a number correctly then nothing will occur. This game will also allow you to select a hint or solve the game all together.

Features include:
A titile that states 'Sudoku Game'
A board that displays the current game
Numbers 1-9 to select then select which box you would like to place the number in
An eraser button to select then select the box you would like to erase
Buttons to select 'Clear Board', 'Solve', 'Hint', 'New Game'
